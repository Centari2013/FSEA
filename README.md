# FSEA Database Project

The FSEA (F-SEA) Database Project is a collaborative project that I am working on with my best friend. It is based on a story that we wrote together and serves as a platform for practicing various skills, including PyQT, OOP, Python, SQLite3, and database design.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive database management and design application. It provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the FSEA database, which contains information about specimens, employees, missions, and more.

## Features

At its current stage of development, the FSEA Database Project offers the following features:

- **User Authentication**: The program includes a login page to authenticate users and ensure secure access to the database.

- **Database Query**: Once logged in, users can access a database query page to perform searches and retrieve information from the FSEA database.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots showcasing the project's functionality:

## Getting Started

To test the application, you can use the following login credentials:

- Username: test
- Password: test

Before running the program, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured.

## Schema

The program is built over an SQLite3 database. Here is the [schema](https://github.com/Centari2013/FSEA/blob/969662d02a4c4a4565d3ba582ec3530f67a8afab/FSEA_DB_Schema.pdf) if you are interested.

For readability purposes, I removed the full text search (FTS) tables from the ER diagram, but they are still mentioned in the document's trigger statements.

## TODO List

Here are the primary tasks that need to be completed for this project:

- **Code Cleanup**: Perform cleanup and refactoring to improve code quality. (always a priority)

- **GUI for Entity Pages**: Implement graphical user interfaces for entity-specific pages, such as specimen details, employee profiles, and mission reports.

- Employee Access Levels: Incorporate different access levels for employees based on their roles and privileges.

- Export Page to PDF: Add functionality to export database pages and search results to PDF format.

- ~~Implement Basic GUI for Search Result Info Page~~ (Completed)

- ~~Implement Simple Search Filters~~ (Completed)

- ~~Implement Full Database Search Engine~~ (Completed)

- ~~Implement Basic Database Search Page GUI~~ (Completed)

Please note that tasks marked with **bold** are currently in progress.
