Project FSEA (Federal Space Exploration Association) is a passion project, based on one of my fictional stories, that serves as an info-base for the association. It is currently bare-bones, but I plan to add much more functionality. 

The main objective of this project is to develop a more in-depth understanding of database design and web application development. 
The UI in the gif is out of date but the functionality and layout is largely the same.
