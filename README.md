# FSEA
F-SEA Database Project
This project is something I am making for my best friend and I. It is based on a story that we wrote together.
This project also serves as practice in PyQT, OOP, python, sqlite3, and database design. 

At this point in time, the program only authenticates users through a login page and opens a page to query 
the database.

The login screen is depicted below. (It is a semi-transparent window.)

The database query page is depicted below.
